* This thesis aims to develop and evaluate machine learning methods for extracting payment information from PDF invoices. Invoices are documents that contain essential information for accounting and financial purposes, such as invoice number, date, amount, tax, and vendor name. However, manually processing invoices is a tedious and error-prone task that requires a lot of human effort and time. Therefore, automating invoice data extraction can improve the efficiency and accuracy of accounting data processing and reduce the operational costs.

* The thesis investigates two main approaches for invoice data extraction: a natural language processing (NLP) approach and an object detection approach. The NLP approach uses a pre-trained BERT model to encode the invoice text and perform named entity recognition (NER) to identify and extract the relevant information. The object detection approach uses a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model to detect and localize the invoice regions and perform optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the text and information from the regions. The thesis compares the performance of the two approaches using various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
